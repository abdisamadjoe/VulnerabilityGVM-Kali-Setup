# Vulnerability-Scan-Setting-Up-OpenVAS-on-Kali-Linux
This project provides a step-by-step guide for installing and setting up OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager, GVM) on Kali Linux, followed by a basic scan on your local machine (127.0.0.1). Screenshots for each step are recommended to ensure a smooth setup.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- **Kali Linux** - Operating system for penetration testing
- **OpenVAS (Greenbone Vulnerability Manager, GVM)** - Vulnerability scanning and management
- **Bash (Terminal)** - Command-line interface for running installation and setup commands

---

## Installation and Setup Steps

### 1. Update Kali Linux

Update your package list to ensure you’re working with the latest available packages:
```bash
sudo apt update
```
Updating helps avoid installation issues and missing dependencies.

### 2. Install GVM

Install the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM), which includes OpenVAS:
```bash
sudo apt install gvm -y
```
The ```-y ``` flag automatically confirms the installation without prompts. This step installs all necessary components for GVM.

### 3. Initialize GVM

To configure your system for OpenVAS, run:
```bash
sudo gvm-setup
```
The setup process may take up to an hour as it retrieves and updates vulnerability feeds. You’ll see different services being set up and initialized one by one, with output lines indicating the current progress.

### 4. Verify the Installation

After setup, check that everything installed correctly:
```bash
sudo gvm-check-setup
```
If any components or feeds are missing, an error will appear. This is common if the feed downloads didn’t complete.

### 5. Fix Feed Errors (If Necessary)

If the previous command shows feed errors, manually sync the feeds with:
```bash
sudo greenbone-feed-sync --type cert
```
Then, rerun the check setup:
```bash
sudo gvm-check-setup
```
This should confirm that your GVM installation is correctly configured.

### 6. Create a New User

Create a user to log into the OpenVAS web interface:
```bash
sudo runuser -u _gvm -- gvmd --create-user=abdisamad --new-password=password
```
Replace ```abdisamad``` and ```password``` with your preferred username and password. This user is for accessing the web interface only.

### 7. Start the OpenVAS Services

Start all necessary OpenVAS services with:
```bash
sudo gvm-start
```
This command launches the web interface and backend services needed for scanning.

### 8. Access the OpenVAS Web Interface

In your browser, go to:
```bash
https://127.0.0.1:9392
```
Log in with the username and password you created in Step 6. Accept the SSL warning if prompted.

### 9. Change the Default Password (First Login)

After logging in for the first time, change your password for added security:
1. Go to Settings in the menu.
2. Change your password and save.

### 10. Run Your First Scan on the Local System

Start a basic scan on your local machine:

1. Go to Scans > Tasks.
2. Select Task Wizard.
3. Enter ```127.0.0.1``` as the Target IP.
4. Click Start Scan to begin.
Once the scan starts, you’ll see it in the Tasks list, where the status will update as it runs.

## Conclusion

You've successfully set up OpenVAS on your Kali Linux machine and conducted your first vulnerability scan. OpenVAS provides powerful tools for identifying potential security weaknesses in your systems. With this foundation, you can explore further by scanning other IP addresses, analyzing scan results, and fine-tuning your vulnerability management strategies.

Regular scanning is essential for maintaining a secure environment, so make OpenVAS a part of your routine security practices. Feel free to reach out for any assistance or share your experiences using this guide.
